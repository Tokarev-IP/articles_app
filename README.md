This app is still developed. I completed only Firebase authorization.
User need a telephone number to get a sms with code. After getting the code user should write it on the next auth screen. If the code is correct, user will be authorized and be on the next (empty) screen.
This app uses Jetpack Compose, Coroutines and MVI architecture with ViewModel and Hilt.
